# Implementation of a PG method using target networks with soft updates in tensorflow


I've never got any good results with PG algorithms.. but im getting comparable results to other implementations of this algorithm so
i guess it works... kind of? Maybe its because PG algorithms need to train on alot of data for along time and im impatient.
